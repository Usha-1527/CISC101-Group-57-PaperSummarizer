Flag sections <50 words.

Apply hallucination mitigation.

Handle long papers with chunking strategies (PS2 context window mitigation).

> 1. **Strict Evidence Mode**: Introduce a **mode or flag** (e.g., `evidence_mode = "strict"`). When it is set to `"strict"`:
>    
>    * The summarizer should:
>      
>      * Only include claims, equations, and results that appear in the provided paper.
>      
>      * If it cannot find enough information, it must say so explicitly (e.g., “The source text does not provide enough detail to summarize this section in strict evidence mode.”) and provide where this information is sourced from.

> 2. **Section Warning Messages**
>    For sections that are:
>    
>    * missing / empty, or
>    
>    * too short (< 50 words)
>    
>    The module must instruct the system to output a **standardized warning**, such as:
> * “Section skipped: no usable text was provided.”
> 
> * “Section very short: summary may be incomplete.”

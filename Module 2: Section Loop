For each section: summarize (≤150 words).

Check constraints (word limits, terminology consistency).

 >  The summarizer supports two summary levels for each section:
   > 
   > * summary_level = "short"
   >   
   >   * 1–2 sentence summary per section
   > 
   > * summary_level = "detailed"
   >   
   >   * A short paragraph **plus** a bullet list of 3–5 key points for each section
   > 
   > **You must:**
   > 
   > * Add a **variables** (e.g., `summary_level`) to the module’s logic.
   > 
   > * Add **conditional behaviors** in the section loop:
   >   
   >   * If `summary_level = "short"` → generate only a compact summary.
   >   
   >   * If `summary_level = "detailed"` → generate summary + bullet list.
>In each case ensure that glossiary is still included
